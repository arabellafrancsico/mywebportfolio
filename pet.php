            <p>This is my fur baby, Chuchi. I took this photo during the pandemic while attending online classes, where she patiently stayed by my side. 
                Even now, with onsite classes keeping me busy, she remains just as sweet—always under my table when I use my computer and following me whenever I leave my room after my school works finished. 
                Her loyalty and affection remind me I’m never truly alone.</p>

            <img src="petpic/pet2.png" alt="Chuchi sleeping on my pillow">
            <p>I took this photo of Chuchi while she was peacefully sleeping on my bed, curled up in her favorite spot—my pillow. It’s funny because my bed is just a single size, meant for one person, yet I often find myself with barely any space to lie down. 
                But honestly, I don’t mind. Seeing her so cozy and comfortable melts my heart every time. She’s just too adorable to disturb, so I always adjust for her. Moments like this are why I couldn’t resist capturing her sweet, peaceful slumber.</p>

            <p>Chuchi has a knack for knowing when we’re about to leave. The moment she hears the car, she races to the garage, eager to hop in. She hates being left behind, and her hopeful face always melts our hearts, so we take her along whenever we can. 
                Once inside, her excitement is contagious—tail wagging and happy licks everywhere. She’s not just a pet; she’s our cheerful travel buddy who makes every trip unforgettable.</p>

            <img src="petpic/pet4.png" alt="Chuchi's 7th birthday celebration">
            <p>This photo was taken during Chuchi’s 7th birthday—a celebration we never skip because she truly deserves it. Every single day, she fills our home with joy and unconditional love, always showing us how much she treasures our family. 
                For 8 years, she’s been a source of happiness, and we know how precious this time is, especially as she grows older. That’s why we give her all the attention, care, and affection she needs, making sure to return the love she has showered on us since the day she became part of our lives. 
                Chuchi isn’t just our pet; she’s family, and every moment with her is a gift.</p>
