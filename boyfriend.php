            <img src="bfpic/bf1.PNG" alt="Boyfriend with his big bike">
            <p>This picture was taken by me as I wanted to capture him with his beloved big bike. I know how much he loves it, and I’m always here to support him in his passions. 
                Motorcycle rides have become a special part of our relationship; every ride brings us closer, allowing us to explore new places, share stories, and build lasting memories together. 
                It’s in those quiet moments on the road that I truly feel connected to him and our bond deepening.</p>

            <img src="bfpic/bf2.jpg" alt="18th Birthday Escort">
            <p>This picture was taken during my 18th birthday, and he was the one who escorted me on that special day. I look at this moment with so much joy, knowing that the man who stood by my side during my debut in 2021 is still the same person walking through life with me today. 
                It’s such a beautiful feeling to know that someone who was part of such a significant day in my life is still here, creating even more cherished memories together. I’m grateful for him and the love we’ve shared, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for us.</p>

            <img src="bfpic/bf3.png" alt="Sagala Support">
            <p>This picture was taken during my "sagala," a traditional Filipino procession, and I’m so thankful that he was there by my side, walking with me through the entire barangay. 
                Even though he was exhausted, he didn’t hesitate to accompany me, offering his support by helping me along the way and even fanning me to keep me cool. 
                He knows how much I enjoy these kinds of events, and his dedication to being there for me means the world. He has always made me feel like a princess, and I’m so grateful to have him by my side for all the special moments, big and small. 
                His love and support make everything even more memorable.</p>

            <p>
                This picture is a reminder of how incredibly lucky I am to have him in my life. I just want to take a moment to appreciate this amazing man for always understanding me, even when I’m hard to deal with and end up snapping at him. 
                Despite all of that, he’s always been there, loving me unconditionally. Everything that has happened between us, from the unexpected start to where we are now, feels like fate. Three years together and I’m still falling more in love with him every day. 
                He’s my first, and I hope he’ll be my last. I’m so thankful for everything he does for me. I love you, always.</p>
