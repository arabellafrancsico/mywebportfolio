            <p>This picture was taken at "Tagpuan sa Lumang Gapan" in Nueva Ecija, during our first long trip as a family after the pandemic. 
                Walking through the streets felt like stepping back in time, with old houses and vintage streetlights giving off an 1880s vibe. 
                The atmosphere was so peaceful and relaxing. We also attended mass at the church, which had a grand, vintage design. 
                Exploring this place with my family and boyfriend was a perfect way to reconnect and create new memories together.</p>

            <p>This picture was taken at the famous "Lion's Head" in Benguet, a must-see stop when traveling to Baguio. On our way up to Baguio with my family, we couldn’t resist taking a photo here. 
                It’s one of those iconic spots that always feels like a milestone on the journey to Baguio. During our stay, we explored so many beautiful places like the Botanical Garden, Burnham Park, Stone Kingdom, and the Strawberry Farm. 
                We spent the night there, enjoying the cool weather and creating wonderful memories. It was such a fun and memorable trip with my loved ones.</p>

            <p>This picture was taken at Boracay Island, my farthest trip yet and also my first time flying on an airplane. I went on this adventure with my two younger brothers and my uncle’s family. 
                Though it was an amazing experience, I couldn’t help but feel a little sad that my parents weren’t with us on this trip. But I promised myself that next time, we’ll all go together. 
                Boracay was everything I imagined and more—this was my first time at the beach, and I was in awe of how beautiful it was. We stayed for 3 days and 1 night, making the most of every moment. 
                The crystal-clear water, the fine, white sand—it truly felt like paradise. This trip holds such a special place in my heart, and I can’t wait to experience it again with the whole family.</p>

            <p>This picture was taken at Digo's Hill in DRT, Bulacan, during my most recent trip. I was with my boyfriend's family, and we traveled there by motorcycle, with me enjoying the backseat of my boyfriend's bike for a 2-hour ride. 
                The journey was long but filled with excitement, and when we arrived, we were greeted with a stunning view of the Sierra Madre mountain range. The serenity and beauty of the place made it so relaxing, and I felt completely at peace. 
                What made this day even more special was the time spent bonding and creating memories with my boyfriend and his family. I absolutely love going on rides with him—it’s one of my favorite things to do, and this trip was no exception. 
                It was a day full of joy and unforgettable moments.</p>
